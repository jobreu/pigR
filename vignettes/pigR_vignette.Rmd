# Introduction

The `pigR` package provides functions to translate English words and sentences to Pig Latin. This vignette will guide you through the usage of the package, including installation, basic usage, and advanced examples.

# Installation

To install the `pigR` package from GitHub, use the following commands:

```r
# Install remotes package if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

# Install `pigR` from *GitHub*
remotes::install_github("jobreu/pigR")
```

# Basic usage

Load the `pigR` package:

```r
library(pigR)
```

## Translating a single word

Use the `pig_word()` function to translate a single English word to Pig Latin:

```r
pig_word("encoding")
#> [1] "encodingway"
```

## Translating a sentence

Use the `pig_sentence()` function to translate an English sentence to Pig Latin:

```r
pig_sentence("I saved latin! What did you ever do?")
#> [1] "iway avedsay atinlay atwhay idday ouyay everway oday"
```

# Advanced examples

## Words with mixed case

The `pig_word()` function handles words with mixed case by converting them to lowercase before translation:

```r
pig_word("Apple")
#> [1] "appleway"
```

## Words with no vowels

The `pig_word()` function handles words with no vowels by appending "ay" to the end of the word:

```r
pig_word("rhythm")
#> [1] "rhythmay"
```

## Sentences with punctuation

The `pig_sentence()` function removes punctuation from the sentence before translation:

```r
pig_sentence("Hello, world!")
#> [1] "ellohay orldway"
```

## Sentences with mixed case

The `pig_sentence()` function handles sentences with mixed case by converting all words to lowercase before translation:

```r
pig_sentence("Mixed CASE sentence.")
#> [1] "ixedmay asecay entencesay"
```

# Summary

The `pigR` package provides simple and easy-to-use functions for translating English words and sentences to Pig Latin. This vignette has covered the basic and advanced usage of the package. For more detailed information, refer to the package documentation and the README file.
